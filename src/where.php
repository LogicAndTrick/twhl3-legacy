	<h1>Where to Start?</h1>
	<p class="single-center-content">
		So, you've arrived at TWHL, but you have no idea where to begin? Well, you've come to the right page (surprise!). But first, if you like what you see, you should most definately <a href="register.php">get an account</a>. It'll make life on TWHL so much easier and loads more fun.
	</p>
	<h3>Beginner</h3>
	<p class="single-center-content">
		If you're a beginner, you'll want to start with one of our introductory tutorials:
	</p>	
	<p class="single-center-content">
		<a href="tutorial.php?id=25">Introduction</a><br />
		This tutorial will give you an overview of some of the mapping concepts you'll need to understand. It explains what maps are, the files you'll need to get everything working, and what to expect when you move over to a modification (like Counter-Strike).
	</p>
	<p class="single-center-content">
		<a href="tutorial.php?id=47">Hammer Setup Guide</a><br />
		This tutorial will help you over the first hurdle you'll encounter - setting up the editor so it actually lets you make maps.	
	</p>	
	<p class="single-center-content">
		<a href="tutorial.php?id=35">Compiling Introduced</a><br />
		Compiling is one of the hardest things for the beginner to get used to. This tutorial should help you put it all together.
	</p>
	<p class="single-center-content">
		<a href="tutorial.php?id=23">In the Beginning</a><br />
		This is a 6-part series of tutorials designed to replace the ones that were dropped from the Worldcraft help files... and go a step further. They cover some fundamental mapping elements: building, lighting, texturing and adding entities.					
	</p>
	<p class="single-center-content">
		You will come across terms you've never heard before: find out what they mean in our <a href="glossary.php">Glossary</a>.
	</p>		
	<p class="single-center-content">
		You'll almost certainly have questions to ask as you get used to mapping. There's nowhere better to ask them than in <a href="forums.php">TWHL's forums</a>!
	</p>
	<p class="single-center-content">
		Then there's the <a href="vault.php">Map Vault</a> - the perfect place to submit maps you're having problems with, so other nice, friendly TWHL members can help you.
	</p>
	<h3>Intermediate</h3>
	<p class="single-center-content">
		You have the basics under your belt, and you'd like to explore more complicated techniques, entities, and mapping for mods. There are plenty of tutorials on complex entities on the <a href="tutorials.php">tutorials page</a>, but you'll probably also need our massive <a href="entity.php">Entity Guide</a> at some stage - it has in-depth info on every entity available in the game.
	</p>	
	<p class="single-center-content">
		You might also like to enter a <a href="competitions.php">competition</a> at some stage... a great way to pit your new skills against other mappers (and you may win a prize or two)!
	</p>
	<h3>Advanced</h3>
	<p class="single-center-content">
		Even if you're an advanced mapper you might still find some nuggets that interest you in our <a href="tutorials.php">tutorials</a>. And of course you can still submit your work to the <a href="vault.php">Vault</a>. It'd also be great if you helped out in the <a href="forums.php">forums</a> by answering questions and being kind to the newbies. :)
