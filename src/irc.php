	<h1>IRC</h1>
	<h2>Thanks to <a href="#">Skeeve</a> for this page!</h2>

	<p class="single-center-content">
		Some of the regulars are complaining that few of the members of our group log on to <a href="irc://irc.gamesurge.net:6667/twhl3">TWHL's IRC channel</a>. It occurred to me that some people may not know what IRC is or how to use the service.
	</p>
	<h3>What is IRC?</h3>
	<p class="single-center-content">
		IRC was a popular way to chat before Instant Messenger services and large services like Microsoft Chat Network switched to web-based clients. The main drawback is you need a software client to use the service, but there are shareware and freeware clients available that you can use. So the software can cost little to nothing, or nothing, to load on your system.
	</p>
	<p class="single-center-content">

		With IRC we can have 20 to 30 (and more) members in the room, sharing ideas, getting help, or just getting to know each other. It is also good place to go if the TWHL site is down (it happens to everyone).
	</p>		
	<h3>Required Software</h3>		
	<p class="single-center-content">
		As mentioned above, a client will be needed on your computer. The table below should be a decent reference to get the needed software. 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.mirc.com/">mIRC</a> - One of the more famous clients. Windows only, shareware based.</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.opera.com">Opera</a> - This web browser has a basic built-in client that should be more than adequate. Windows, OSX, and Linux, free.</li>
		<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/16">ChatZilla</a> - ChatZilla is a free add-on for the FireFox browser. Windows, OSX, and Linux, free.</li>
		<li><a href="http://xchat.org/">XChat</a> - XChat is a popular choice for Linux users. Windows and Linux, free.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Settings</h3>
	<p class="single-center-content">
		We use <a href="http://www.gamesurge.net/">Gamesurge</a> as our IRC host. 
	</p>

	<p class="single-center-content">
		Settings for your client are as follows: <br />
		<strong>IRC server</strong>: irc.gamesurge.net <br />
		<strong>Port</strong>: 6667 <br />
		<strong>Channel</strong>: #twhl
	</p>	
	<p class="single-center-content">
		If you're on default settings, install your client and click this link in any browser (for Opera IRC you should click it from Opera):
	</p>
	<p class="single-center-content">
		<a href="irc://irc.gamesurge.net/twhl">irc://irc.gamesurge.net/twhl</a>
	</p>
	<p class="single-center-content">
		After that you can play with the settings and configure it how you like.<br />
		If you have a proxy you'll have to configure your client for it.
	</p>
	<p class="single-center-content">
		That should about cover the basics, so we hope to see you in the chat room. :)
