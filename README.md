First up:

# **DO NOT RUN THIS CODE ANYWHERE**

I'm serious. It's horrible code, written in a very insecure way, and is probably vulnerable to all sorts of SQL injections. In the unlikely possibility that you want to run this code, you can't, because the license forbids it. Also there's no database scripts and I will not provide you with one.

Now that this code is no longer running on any of my servers, I feel safe that I can publish this monstrosity. You shouldn't look at it, but here it is anyway.

This code was mostly written when I was in high school, and should not be considered representative of my current coding ability. See the modern [TWHL repository](https://github.com/LogicAndTrick/twhl) for something that isn't cancerous.

License is the Microsoft Reference Source, which means you can read the code, but cannot redistribute, modify, or execute it. I chose this license for your own safety. Just look at it, weep, and know what not to do.
